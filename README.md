<h1>hello there!</h1>

this small bash script is supposed to ease your work by generating in your current directory the folder structure used mostly in C

You need one or two arguments:

- \$1(the first): the name of the new folder with the C project structure

- \$2(the second), optional: the PATH of the templates folder\nex: folderC sara ~/Downloads/Ctemplates"


if you copy the 'folderC' file to your /bin directory and give it execution permission 'chmod +x folderC' you may execute it just by calling the command 'folderc $1 $2'


not complex but does the job :)
