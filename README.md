hello there!
this small bash script is supposed to ease your work by generating in your current directory the folder structure used mostly in C
if you copy the 'folderC' file to your /bin directory and give it execution permission '+x folderC' you may execute it just by calling the command 'folderc'
not complex but does the job :)
